Rules and Explanations for South Croatian Famine Blackjack:

1. Your finger represent your max bet, while your eyes represents your lives in a way. This goes the same way for your enemy.
  
2. You can use the number changer or input your own number into the input box.
  
3. If you input a number larger than your max bet, it will default to your max bet.
  
4. Likewise, if you input a number lower than one, it will default to one.
  
5. Once you lose all your fingers, you will have to bet your eyes. In this case, your bet will be defaulted to you either losing one eye, or the foe losing two fingers no matter what you input.
   This goes the same way for his foe.
   
6. In the case you and foe are both down to their eyes, you will simply bet an eye for an eye.
   
7. Once you lose an eye, your fingers are reset back to 5, unless your eyes become zero, then you shall lose. This goes the same for the enemy.

8. In the case you tie, nothing happens and you go again.

9. Beside these cases, the rules are the same as Blackjack. Get a higher number than your enemy, without going over 21.
